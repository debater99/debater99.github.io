        <h2>Videographer, Photographer, Public Speaker, and Writer.</h2>
        
         <p>I am a media creator living in Knoxville, TN. I love communicating through videos, images, 
		 blog posts, and speeches.
         </p>
         <p>
            I work as a team member at Chick-Fil-A. I usually work in our store's drive thru, 
            which is currently ranked 13th in the nation. 
         </p> 
		 <p>
			I also compete in public speaking
            and debate. I have received over 40 awards for public speaking and debate, including 15  
            top-two placings, and I am a two-time semifinalist in Apologetics at the 
			<a href="http://www.ncfca.org/">NCFCA</a>
			National Championship. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have worked on numerous film projects, including short films,
			wedding videos, promotional films, commercials, and music videos. 
			I have also served as an event photographer on numerous occasions.
			I am a member of
